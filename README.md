1. Access to Google Colab or some Jupyter Notebook.
2. Basic python programing.
3. Basic arithmetic & calculus knowledge

### Intro: What is Linear Regression?
This deals with understanding the pattern/ slope of a given dataset given the assumption that the dataset has a linear pattern. Basically predicting the value of a variable based off the value of another variable.

Given a formulars of a line and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as below
* $\hat{y} = wx + b$
* $MSE = \frac{1}{N} \Sigma_{i=1}^n({y}-\hat{y})^2 = \frac{1}{N} \Sigma_{i=1}^n({y}- (w_{i}x + b))^2$
